Predictive Analysis using Regression

Here is the process & outcomes I found from this data.
 
Dependent Variable is tip in this data
Rest all paramenters are independent variables.
I have converted all text columns into numeric values(Sex, Smoker, Day, Time)
Then I run the regression on it and got regression chart with R Square as 0.47 
which means my data accuracy is 47%.
By seeing the P-value we can judge that tip is highly dpendent on Total bill.
Then I applied the formula to calculate Predicred value 
Error is calculated by subtracting the predicted value with actual value (tip)
And calculated the Square error as few values are in negative
Calculated the Average Sq error and Root mean square error
By calculating the error percentage we can say that this data has chances of error by 34%
